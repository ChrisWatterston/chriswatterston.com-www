Then it&#039;s time to recognition, plan, and ensure the online world for Education platforms are able to handle what was to come.<\/h2><p>Expect huge spikes in site traffic, visitors, page views, and requests.<\/p><p>On 28th February 2018, around 6AM, just this happened. Snow swept the UK nation and parents took to the internet. Wondering <em>and wishing<\/em> whether their sons or daughters school will be closed. This resulted in visiting schools websites. But not just a single visit, parents are on a missions to refresh the page as many time needed, until the school reveals the answer on their website.<\/p><h3>The average day<\/h3><p>On the average day, again around 6AM, a secondary school website takes around 60 page views. This are &lsquo;page views&rsquo; not &lsquo;sessions&rsquo;. If you visit a websites homepage and continue to navigate through to the contact page, that&#039;s recorded as 2 page views and 1 session.<\/p><p>Seems a fairly low page view number? It may be, but remember this is not a website that is selling a product or providing a service. A school website&rsquo;s main goal is to update parents and students with information about day-to-day school life, exam results, and maybe some news. Pretty easy stuff.<\/p><h3>The snow day<\/h3><p>This is where things get pretty crazy. Not keeping an eye on the weather and news as a web host system administrator for education, snow can really catch you off guard!<\/p><p>To a point where server failure would be guaranteed, with persistent parents being slapped with 500 server errors. Something that obviously CANNOT happen, of all days! So how crazy do things get?<\/p><p>During the course of Black Friday and Cyber Mondays, online shops generally see a 100 to 200% increase in traffic. Nice!

Using services such as the; Virtual Networks (vNet), Virtual Machines (VM), Insights, Storage Accounts, Network Security Groups (NSG), Recovery Service Vaults, Web App Services, etc. All used to build and maintain solutions for both client and personal needs.<\/h2><h3>For this read, I&#039;ll focus on two solutions available within the Azure suite, and why relying on the Web App Services for hosting may actually not be the best solution. Instead&ndash; you might want to consider spinning up a Virtual Machine (VM)!<\/h3><p>On paper, the <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-gb\/services\/app-service\/\" title=\"\">Microsoft Azure App Service<\/a> looks great and seems the most viable solution. I mean, it has been purpose built to enable customers to quickly deploy powerful cloud apps using the fully managed platform. You won&rsquo;t need to worry about installing .NET, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, Python... It&rsquo;s all been done for you. Just needs enabling with a tap of a button. <em>I&rsquo;m selling this to you, aren&rsquo;t I?<\/em><\/p><p>But before we all get to pumped, let&#039;s take a trip to where it all started.<\/p><h3>The Beginning<\/h3><p>When you get started with the Azure Web App Service, everything ran as you&#039;d expect. I was excited! Apps were easy to configure, and quick to deploy via Github. Things ran smoothly without a hick-up for months. I was in heaven; this was effortless and worry free&ndash; what a solution!!<\/p><blockquote><p>&quot;Well done to the Azure team 🙌&quot;<\/p><\/blockquote><p>I didn&#039;t hesitate in pushing the remainder of my clients of all shapes and sizes onto the solution, why wouldn&#039;t I!<\/p><p>But as time passed, I started to notice very small outages on some of my client Web Apps. They were totally random and weren&#039;t anything big at this point. And to be fair, I likely only noticed these outages because I monitored these Web Apps 24\/7.<\/p><blockquote><p>For monitoring the web apps, I used <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pingdom.com\/\" title=\"\">Pingdom<\/a>. With a network of 60+ probe servers, Pingdom tests are available from all over the world, as often as every minute. If there&#039;s an outage, Pingdom can alert you within milliseconds, ensuring you&rsquo;re the first to know.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The outage alerts came in, but before I could jump onto Azure to look into resolving outage, the Web Apps would come back online. After a few weeks of this happening, I put my research hat on.<\/p><p>I started to notice the outages were taking place in &lsquo;off-peak hours&rsquo; and would never fail during normal working day hours. Annoying! But either way, I decided to turn a blind eye and assumed the outages were simply a bit of Azure internal maintenance and would soon be a thing of the past.<\/p><p>[image: chriswatterston.com\/application\/files\/3715\/1998\/6028\/azure-app-service-outages.jpg]<\/p><p><em>Showing past 6 months uptime\/outages of apps running via <\/em><strong><em>App Service<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p>[image: chriswatterston.com\/application\/files\/7815\/1998\/6026\/azure-virtual-machine-outages.jpg]<\/p><p><em>Showing past 6 months uptime\/outages of apps running via <\/em><strong><em>Virtual Machine<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p>Outages occurring about twice a month, then unexpectedly increasing to once a week. Then blowing up to become a serious issue, with outages now taking place multiple times throughout every evening and night.<\/p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t simply ignore this. The outage periods were lasting longer and started displaying &ldquo;Page cannot be displayed because an internal server error has occurred&rdquo; errors when attempting to reload Web Apps in a browser.<\/p><p>This service charges my clients &pound;60+ a month (exc. the additional scale-out costs). The fact is, this was more unreliable than a &pound;4 a month hosting solution&ndash; it&#039;s not great. I&rsquo;ve done my fair rounds with hosting providers over the years, so I know.<\/p><h3>Find the cause<\/h3><p>Resolving the never-ending growing issues with the Web App Services was not #1 on my priority list. At this point, the only solution was to report the issue to the Azure support team.<\/p><p>We enable service logging in the hope that we&#039;d capture what the cause of the outages was, but it didn&rsquo;t. In fact, logging didn&rsquo;t pick up anything with the service, which I found a little odd and hard to believe.<\/p><p>The only captured logs, a handful of PHP errors, pages not found, or stale sessions. Nothing out of the ordinary had been captured, not even a cheeky tease about the internal server error.<\/p><p>I continually received endless Web App Service outages. Still throughout the evenings and nights, across multiple separate subscriptions. There wasn&#039;t any <a href=\"https:\/\/status.azure.com\/en-us\/status\" title=\"\">regional Health Issues showing<\/a> and Azure support started saying the outages are caused by &quot;storage migrations&rdquo;.<\/p><p>Outages continued, &ldquo;PING&rdquo;&hellip; &ldquo;PING&rdquo;&hellip; &ldquo;PING&rdquo;&hellip; &ldquo;PING&rdquo;&hellip; &ldquo;PING&rdquo;&hellip; every evening and night. <em>This was now really starting to piss me off!!<\/em><\/p><p>The hunt continues&hellip;<\/p><h3>Why a Virtual Machine<\/h3><p>When being offered a managed service, there shouldn&#039;t be a need to worry about how stable and reliable the service will be. I have years of experience in managing hosting infrastructure, I felt helpless and completely out of control with the Web App Service.<\/p><p>When a Web App Service goes offline, or unresponsive, there is no access to root level or even perform a simply reboot. You don&rsquo;t have an accessible &ldquo;host&rdquo; with Web App Services, it&#039;s basically a shared cloud host. The only option you have is Azure support, but even then, a <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-gb\/support\/plans\/\" title=\"\">support SLA<\/a> is required. <\/p><p>Which is why I would recommend anyone weighting up the options of the Web App Service, to consider the Virtual Machine.<\/p><p>Comparing the Pros and Cons between the Web App Service and Virtual Machine (VM)&ndash; I feel the only Con for the VM is needing basic system build experience. For example, you&#039;ll need to build and configure your Ubuntu (Windows is also available) host. Even then, a friendly freelance experts will be readily available to support you.<\/p><p>At the time of choosing my Azure services, I only chose a VM because the Ubuntu Web App Services Beta had only just been announced. I had to make a rapid host move from <a href=\"https:\/\/mediatemple.net\/\" title=\"\">Media Temple<\/a>, to a UK based hosting provider and Azure ticked all the boxes. I also liked and enjoyed that I had free rein over the VM.<\/p><p>Full control over installs of Apache, PHP, MySQL, storage location, cache, and much more. Plus, control over tracing errors and failures. I would be able to resolve internal server errors myself&ndash; OMFG! As we know, something you can&#039;t do with the Web App Service.<\/p><p>Uptime and response rates have also proven considerably better via the VM, compared to the Web App Services*.<\/p><p>So now looking back to when I first made the switch to Azure. If I had to do it all over again, I&#039;d have chosen the <strong>Virtual Machine<\/strong> again over the Web App Service.<\/p><h3>The resolution<\/h3><p>The outages have not yet been formally resolved, but we are liaising with the Azure team to trace and resolve the outages with the Web App Service. I&#039;ll continue to provide updates as and when they happen.<\/p><h4>Making your choice or need advice<\/h4><p>If you&#039;re in the position of making a switch to Azure and want to ask a question?

Through 2017, I probably focused more with home life over that of work which definitely had an impact as a whole. As a result, work life had not been as successful as I had hoped for, partly due to frustrating project holdups (which being freelance, we don&rsquo;t get paid for). For 2018, I want to shake the past off and put that behind me. I want to avoid these downfalls and continuously grab and bring new opportunities to life. It&rsquo;s my passion and what I truly enjoy.<\/h2><h3>1. Detach Distractions<\/h3><p>I want to simplify my life and the things around me. If there are activities going on around me that doesn&rsquo;t require my involvement, then I&rsquo;m staying away. I want to keep a straight and narrow mind set on my goals throughout 2018, which I will remind myself of every day.\n\nWith less distractions and more focus on the areas of work that matter, what I will achieve is going to be very exciting!<\/p><h3>2. Officially Launch SKOOLping&reg;<\/h3><p>I aimed to launch my own project during the middle of 2017, but&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.chriswatterston.com\/blog\/progress-on-skoolping-and-why-theres-been-a-substantial-delay\" title=\"\">unfortunately during the first few months I became faced with a few hurdles<\/a>&nbsp;- but with collaboration we can now get back to it. The&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.skoolping.co.uk\/\" title=\"\">SKOOLping website was designed and developed<\/a>&nbsp;towards the end of 2017, and has recently gone live - but unfortunately (due to the above) our app is still within the development stages.\n\nLearning an in-depth understanding of the programming language &lsquo;<a href=\"https:\/\/swift.org\/\" title=\"\">Swift<\/a>&rsquo; (including&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cocoa_Touch\" title=\"\">CocoaTouch for iOS<\/a>) was a goal for 2017 and creating this application was to become part that. I&rsquo;ve now moved this huge goal and will reset for 2018. I&rsquo;m also very excited about how I progress and grow with my profession for Swift, and what opportunities this new skill will bring.<\/p><h3>3. New Clients &amp; Contracts (with commute or via remote)<\/h3><p>I worked and collaborated with a few new clients throughout 2017, which was fantastic! Now turning things up for 2018 -&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.chriswatterston.com\/get-in-contact\" title=\"\">I want to meet, work and collaborate with new clients and organisations<\/a>. Maybe even work alongside a team of talented folk on exciting projects. I want to excel myself and become an essential part of a team, or as a freelance individual.<\/p><h3>4. Network More, Attend Events<\/h3><p>When you&rsquo;re working as a freelancer, working within a separate office away from your home, but STILL located within the boundaries of your property, it can get a little too comfortable. This results in not getting out and about in the world, such as commuting to a place of work. This also means that I, yes I&rsquo;ll admit it, didn&rsquo;t make an effort to attend events that I&rsquo;m interested in as much as I wanted to in and around London. I only attended two events in 2017, which were a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-gb\/\" title=\"\">Microsoft Azure<\/a>&nbsp;bootcamp and another about UAV Safety and Airspace.\n\nI&rsquo;m getting out there for 2018. I&rsquo;m going to make a keen effort to make sure I attend as many events that relate to my skillset as I can. Whether this are small meetings, or large global based events, I&rsquo;m going to make an effort to be there&hellip; even hanging out online.<\/p><h3>5. Work Towards Certification(s)<\/h3><p>Being a freelance full-stack designer, means that it&rsquo;s quite hard to focus and specialise on one particular area. For example; working towards&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-gb\/\" title=\"\">certification for Microsoft Azure<\/a>. Yes I use Azure daily, but I also use other platforms too, such also&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/\" title=\"\">Google Cloud<\/a>. This means that it&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>quite hard<\/em>&nbsp;to take the time to study and sit the exams to obtain the certification. Also, what would I gain from having a Microsoft Azure certification against my name? 98% of my clients haven&rsquo;t even heard of Azure. This means there has been no beneficial reason in the past to obtain and take time towards these certifications. My&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.chriswatterston.com\/designer-developer-solutions-and-services\" title=\"\">clients pay me to build and provide them with solutions<\/a>, they don&rsquo;t pay me to use a particular platforms.\n\nFor 2018, I&rsquo;m going to make an attempt to obtain as many certification for the platforms I use as I can. I may only get around to achieving one certification, but time will tell.<\/p><h3>6. Explore Artificial Intelligence (AI) &amp; Blockchain Foundation<\/h3><p>Finding the time to research deeper into&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Artificial_intelligence\" title=\"\">Artificial Intelligence (AI)<\/a>&nbsp;has been on the &ldquo;To Do&rdquo; list for a few months already, but haven&rsquo;t yet found the time - no surprise there!\n\nThe&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/worldblockchain.foundation\/\" title=\"\">Blockchain Foundation<\/a>&nbsp;is a fairly new one. Reading into it a while back explained how this new technology can change thing for the better and stack history (pun intended). This will defiantly be a much discussed subject for 2018 amongst tech companies and I will be very interested in how the Blockchain is implement into day-to-day things. I may even take advantage of Blockchain in a future project, who knows.<\/p>"},{"articleLiveDate":"2018-01-03T23:00:00Z","articleUpdateDate":null,"articleTitle":"Meltdown and Spectre Vulnerability CPU Flaw Update","articleUrlSlug":"meltdown-spectre-cpu-flaw-update","articleDescription":"Confirmed security and protection against Meltdown & Spectre, a CPU flaw from CPU vulnerability that could effect your hosting infrastructure","articleHeroImage":{"sys":{"id":"784m1n7EhmRpqy0pEaJXFc","type":"Asset","revision":1,"createdAt":"2022-09-01T12:31:36.429Z","updatedAt":"2022-09-01T12:31:36.429Z","environment":{"sys":{"type":"Link","id":"master","linkType":"Environment"}},"locale":"en-GB","space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","id":"b7oivln51zxg","linkType":"Space"}}},"fields":{"title":"Photo by Oxa Roxa, via Unslash - https:\/\/unsplash.com\/photos\/9naPgAUBo2g","description":"","file":{"fileName":"chris-watterston-meltdown-spectre-update.jpg","contentType":"image\/jpeg","details":{"size":24666,"image":{"width":1440,"height":960}},"url":"\/\/images.ctfassets.net\/b7oivln51zxg\/784m1n7EhmRpqy0pEaJXFc\/ddf9d7d3bb7b3fe51e2da82ab7ba8d6d\/chris-watterston-meltdown-spectre-update.jpg"}}},"articleBody":"<h2><strong>Hosting infrastructure coverage confirmation on security and protection, against Meltdown and Spectre.

I&rsquo;ve seen some with true meaning, and others with no meaning behind them (apart from the general message of &ldquo;this is what we sell&rdquo;).<\/h2><h2>Without looking into their true meanings, I&rsquo;ll outline what message I get from first impression watching, explained in a nutshell, but not in a long winded way - I won&rsquo;t be getting the nutcracker out just yet (pun intended).<\/h2><h3>BBC One - The Supporting Act<\/h3><p>This is an advert that I can relate to. I have a family that want my attention, but I also have to give attention to my&nbsp;business. Similar to this fantastic advert, I work but at the same time also pay attention to what&#039;s happening around me. The hard working&nbsp;single father in this advert works every second of the day, but when the time finally come that he can show his daughter that he does, it&rsquo;s too late and she storms out the room. The night of the Winter Show finally comes and she&rsquo;s seen peeking through the curtains looking for her dad, but thinks work has taken priority yet again. But to her surprise, her loving dad is watching. He realises her nerves, puts away his phone and&nbsp;stands up. From the back of the hall, he supports her&nbsp;by showing that he <strong>DID<\/strong> pay attention to her every move. This is a very well thought out and stunning advert, and defiantly my #1 for the 2017 Christmas Advert lineup.<\/p><p>[youtube-start:8PstSiTCk74:youtube-end]<\/p><h3>M&amp;S - Paddington &amp; The Christmas Visitor<\/h3><p>M&amp;S show the gift of giving when Paddington assists a burglar, that Paddington mistakes for Santa, to deliver&nbsp;all the presents&nbsp;to the the children (that he had really just stolen). After their night together, the burglar takes a turn for the better&nbsp;and realises that the gift of giving is a much warm hearted way.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/KfaSxIkLslE\" title=\"\">Watch the M&amp;S advert<\/a><\/p><h3>John Lewis - #MozTheMonster<\/h3><p>John Lewis are showing that just a little thought into a gift, can be truly beautiful. Like many children, the boy doesn&rsquo;t get much sleep because the &ldquo;monster under the bed&rdquo; keeps him awake during the night. And after time it really starts to show. The monster decides to do the right thing and give&nbsp;a gift of a night light&nbsp;to help the boy sleep at nights - putting his mind at rest about the monster.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/Jw1Y-zhQURU\" title=\"\">Watch the John Lewis advert<\/a><\/p><h3>Asda - Best Christmas Ever<\/h3><p>I&rsquo;m not sure what message I get from Asda&#039;s advert, apart from that their food gets made in a unique Elf factory. It somewhat reminds me of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. A second watch gives the impressions that maybe they want to show how much dedication they put in the quality of their food?\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/Rd9wKCy1pAE\" title=\"\">Watch the Asda advert<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p><h3>Debenhams - #YouShall Find Your Fairytale Christmas (Part 1 &amp; 2)<\/h3><p>This is like watching a series on TV, maybe a Cinderella type cliff hangers. A story line that relates to reality, with social media sharing their story to help find her shoe. Their reunion&nbsp;leaves your heart warm and waiting for your wedding invite - stunning.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/fyNhzFYP3ts\" title=\"\">Watch the Debenhams advert<\/a><\/p><h3>Sainsbury&rsquo;s - #everybitofChristmas<\/h3><p>Sainsbury&rsquo;s theme this years is a catchy one, although I likely won&rsquo;t be learning it this tune. But I&rsquo;m not sure what the message is here - any ideas?\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/WU50dLLy7Cw\" title=\"\">Watch the Sainsbury&#039;s advert<\/a><\/p><h3>Tesco - Turkey, Every Which Way<\/h3><p>The title of Tesco&rsquo;s Christmas Advert speaks for itself, and is enough too warm&nbsp;the&nbsp;cockles&nbsp;of one&#039;s heart. Tesco shows that whatever family relation you are; religion, race, culture - you are welcome at Tesco. Everyone is welcome at Christmas and to celebrate.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/qSUkAURUU1I\" title=\"\">Watch the Tesco advert<\/a><\/p><h3>Barbour - The Snowman and The Snowdog<\/h3><p>I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of Barbour, their range shows quality. Watching their advert, they tell a story about a Snowman that gave a little boy a dog for Christmas. Years pass and the little boy turns into an Adult, who turns into a parent, who remembers the his old friend, The Snowman, at this giving time of the year. Christmas morning arrives, and so does the much loved and ever giving Snowman. But this year, the not so little boy&rsquo;s family give&nbsp;back to the Snowman, showing that his gifts were never forgotten - It just happens that this gift is a Barbour waxed coat. Give something worth remembering this Christmas, with quality.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/vkIjXeYBit0\" title=\"\">Watch the Barbour advert<\/a><\/p><h3>Argos - #ReadyForTakeOff<\/h3><p>Argos will pulls out all the stops to ensure delivery of your Christmas.

He eventually falls in the arms of his &ldquo;love at first sight&rdquo;, and saves her from peeing herself. Aldi push a message that Christmas is a time for loved ones to come together, and it&#039;s worth peeing yourself for the ones you love - just don&#039;t do it in public!\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/iJGpOYKXcSE\" title=\"\">Watch the Aldi advert<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p><h3>Lidl - Mince Pie Maverick<\/h3><p>This advert is directed towards me. I&rsquo;m a bit of a mince pie fan boy, and just watching this makes me weak at the knees - just the thought of a piping hot mince pie with cold cream, oh sh*t! The price seems reasonable for mince pies, too.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/GIn-52yrrPI\" title=\"\">Watch the Lidl advert<\/a><\/p><h3>House of Fraser&nbsp;- Bring Merry Back<\/h3><p>We all have that annoying someone, whether it&rsquo;s around Christmas or just generally every day. House of Fraser shows that we should push that feeling aside (however annoying they are) and bring Merry back with a smile, gift and love all around.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/2PvPqn4dSYc\" title=\"\">Watch the House of Fraser advert<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p><h3>Toys &#039;R&#039; Us - Geoffrey the Part Time Reindeer<\/h3><p>Toys &lsquo;R&rsquo; Us shows that they can provide every gift, and it&#039;s all located under one roof - and it seems that even the reindeers can&rsquo;t resist. Thankfully the long and loyal Geoffery is here to help yet again, from stacking the shelves to pulling Santa around in his sleigh and putting presents down our chimneys.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/B72y_OByf_4\" title=\"\">Watch the Toys &#039;R&#039; Us advert<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p><h3>Currys PC World - Ahmed&rsquo;s Run<\/h3><p>This one brought a smile to my face as it relates to real life events. A Currys PC World employee is trialing products prior to selling them in store, enabling him to understand how and what they can be used for. I thought this was a good one as it had comedy roots, and again has real meaning behind it.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/9kGTIaoyTOc\" title=\"\">Watch the Currys PC World advert<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p><h3>Co-op - Christmas is coming together<\/h3><p>Another heart warning advert about coming together. Similar to that of Tesco, it shows different religions, race and&nbsp;cultures. All coming together and enjoying this time of the year - showing that love really&nbsp;is the greatest gift.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/2CHM9W59slA\" title=\"\">Watch the Co-op advert<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Have I missed one, or one you think needs to have a place?

Used to bind and secure your web applications.<\/h2><h2>I&#039;ve created this tutorial to help, and hopefully answer any questions you may have in relation to this process. So, how do we create a .PFX file for Microsoft Azure?<\/h2><p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-gb\/\" title=\"\">Azure<\/a> is a powerful cloud computing service created by Microsoft, for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through a global network of data centres. Microsoft initially released Azure in 2010, and since has&nbsp;exploded, and is continuing to grow and change every single day.<\/p><h3>1. Generating a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)<\/h3><p>The nature in which Azure is build (a cloud service), means that the&nbsp;CSR and private key cannot be generated on the&nbsp;server. Instead, we need to use our own computer (likely what you&#039;re reading this article on), or&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Virtual_machine\" title=\"\">virtual&nbsp;machine<\/a>. I&rsquo;m a daily Mac user, so like to use a &lsquo;Windows 10&rsquo; virtual machine to perform this type of task.\n\nOpen the Windows application&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.iis.net\/\" title=\"\">Internet Information Services (IIS)<\/a>&nbsp;and select &lsquo;Server Certificates&rsquo; within the root &lsquo;Connections&rsquo; tree list. Over on the right within the &lsquo;Actions&rsquo; panel, select &lsquo;Create Certificate Request&rsquo; - continue following the onscreen instructions until you have saved and opened up your TXT file in front of you.<\/p><blockquote><p>Find out how to install IIS on your machine at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lansweeper.com\/knowledgebase\/how-to-install-iis\/\" title=\"\">lansweeper.com\/knowledgebase\/how-to-install-iis\/<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote><p>[image: chriswatterston.com\/application\/files\/5615\/1150\/9770\/tut-createpfx-step1.jpg]<\/p><h3>2. Submitting CSR to a Certificate&nbsp;Authority&nbsp;(CA)<\/h3><p>Once you have&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.godaddy.com\/en-uk\/web-security\/ssl-certificate\" title=\"\">purchased an SSL certificate<\/a> at you preferred CA, you&rsquo;ll be required to submit your CSR into their system. Every CA will have a slightly different process to follow, but it should be fairly simple.\n\nNow that you&rsquo;ve submitted your CSR, you will likely be required to complete some form of &lsquo;Domain Access Verification&rsquo;. This is normally achieved by adding a TXT record into the domain&rsquo;s DNS, for which you are purchasing and applying the SSL against.\n\n<em><strong>BUT I want to create a PFX for an existing SSL certificate?<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s fine. Instead of buying a new SSL, you&#039;ll just need to &lsquo;Rekey&rsquo; your existing certificate. You can do this by re-submitting a new CSR to the CA provider. Every CA have different methods, but it should be a simple process.<\/p><p>[image: chriswatterston.com\/application\/files\/7115\/1143\/9383\/tut-import-step2.jpg]<\/p><h3>3. Downloading and Importing Certificate<\/h3><p>Now that you have successfully completed all the domain verification processes, you will now be able to download your certificate files. Some CAs allow you to do this in a number of different formats (Exchange, Apache, ISS, etc). It&rsquo;s normally good practice to download the files for the method you used to create the CSR, therefor I will be downloading the files for IIS.\n\nAfter downloading, extract the ZIPPED (.zip) files onto your Desktop. Jumping back into IIS, under the &lsquo;Actions&rsquo; panel as before, select &lsquo;Complete Certificate Request&rsquo;.<\/p><p>Locate and select the certificate file (.crt) which you download within the ZIPPED (.zip) file. Enter a recognisable and friendly name and click &lsquo;Ok&rsquo;.<\/p><p>You should now be able to see your imported certificate within the IIS &lsquo;Server Certificates&rsquo; list. Let&rsquo;s move onto exporting the PFX file for Azure.<\/p><h3>4. Exporting PFX ready for Azure<\/h3><p>Open up console by typing &lsquo;mmc&rsquo; into &lsquo;Run&rsquo; (Windows + R). In the console, click &lsquo;File&rsquo; and &lsquo;Add\/Remove Snap-ins&hellip;&rsquo;.<\/p><p>Select and add &lsquo;Certificates&rsquo;, choosing to manage for &lsquo;Computer Accounts&rsquo; during the process.\n\nAfter loading the &lsquo;Certificates&rsquo; Snap-in, within the console tree list expand &lsquo;Certificates &gt; Personal &gt; Certificates&rsquo;. You should now see your certificate listed.<\/p><p>Right Click the certificate and Select &lsquo;All Tasks &gt; Export&hellip;&rsquo;. During the process, make sure that you select &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; when asked to export the private key and that the following options are selected - ensure that the option &lsquo;Delete the private key if the export is successful&rsquo; is <u>UNSELECTED<\/u> ... <em>otherwise this whole process is a waste of time.<\/em><\/p><blockquote><p><strong>NOTE:<\/strong>&nbsp;During the process, ensure that you give your exported PFX a strong password. Remember to write that password down, as you&rsquo;ll need to when you import into Azure.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>[image: chriswatterston.com\/application\/files\/3115\/1143\/9389\/tut-export-step3.jpg]<\/p><p><strong>Congratulation!<\/strong> Now that you have your PFX file ready and waiting, we can now&nbsp;import straight into Azure.<\/p><h3>5. Importing the PFX into Azure<\/h3><p><a href=\"https:\/\/portal.azure.com\/\" title=\"\">Sign into your Azure account<\/a>, select the App you wish to apply the SSL against and open &lsquo;SSL Certificates&rsquo;. Select &lsquo;Upload Certificate&rsquo; and browse for the PFX (.pfx) file you created, making sure you enter&nbsp;your strong password&nbsp;- and finally finish by clicking &lsquo;Upload&rsquo;.<\/p><p>[image: chriswatterston.com\/application\/files\/3515\/1143\/9387\/tut-pass-step5.jpg]<\/p><p>You can now continue to add SSL Binding to your web app, or apps&nbsp;if you have a wildcard, to enable your site to use the certificate and load as HTTPS 🎉<\/p>"},{"articleLiveDate":"2017-11-16T23:00:00Z","articleUpdateDate":null,"articleTitle":"A brief breakdown of GDPR, as outlined by the ICO","articleUrlSlug":"brief-breakdown-gdpr-ico","articleDescription":"It can be overwhelming when new laws and regulations are introduced.

This will hopefully enable others to quickly and effectively understand and take in what needs to be understood. So without further ado, let&rsquo;s dive straight in.<\/h2><h3>What is the GDPR?<\/h3><p>GDPR, in full stands for&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/ico.org.uk\/for-organisations\/data-protection-reform\/overview-of-the-gdpr\/\" title=\"\">General Data Protection Regulation<\/a>, which is a new legal framework that is being enforced within the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/europa.eu\/european-union\/index_en\" title=\"\">European Union<\/a>&nbsp;(EU) and is replacing the current&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/ico.org.uk\/for-organisations\/guide-to-data-protection\/\" title=\"\">Data Protection Act 1998<\/a>&nbsp;(DPA). The GDPR has similarities with the existing DPA, but has a number of new and amended requirements.<\/p><h3>Why the GDPR?<\/h3><p>GDPR has been introduced to provide a law for data protection, for everyone. It&rsquo;s been introduced to provide individuals with rights over their data because having a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Safeguard\" title=\"\">safeguarded<\/a>&nbsp;system in place is more important than ever, given the growing&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Digital_economy\" title=\"\">digital economy<\/a>.<\/p><h3>When is the deadline?<\/h3><p>GDPR for the UK will go into force from 25th&nbsp;May, 2018. It&rsquo;s confirmed that the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU will not affect the enforcement of the GDPR. It&rsquo;s important for organisations to prepare for GDPR ahead of this deadline.<\/p><h3>Who does the GDPR apply to?<\/h3><p>GDPR applies to all personal data &rsquo;controllers&rsquo; and&nbsp;&lsquo;processors&rsquo; of organisations operating within the EU, and worldwide organisations outside the EU that offer goods or services to individuals within the EU.<\/p><blockquote><p><em>&lsquo;<\/em><strong><em>controller<\/em><\/strong><em>&rsquo; is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.\n\n&lsquo;<\/em><strong><em>processor<\/em><\/strong><em>&rsquo; means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote><p>For example, if &lsquo;Your Co.&rsquo; sells clothing to shoppers and uses &lsquo;eMarketing Co.&rsquo; to send emails to customers on your behalf, which also tracks their email engagement, then in relation to such email data, &lsquo;Your Co.&rsquo; is the controller, and &lsquo;eMarketing Co.&rsquo; is the processor.<\/p><p>Organisations must now be responsible for obtaining and keeping a thorough record of how and when an individual gives legitimate consent to store and use their personal data. Consent now means active agreement.<\/p><p>For example, consent can no longer be obtained by a pre-ticked box. Organisations that control how and why data is processed will have to show a clear audit trail of consent provided by the individual. This may include screen shots\/grabs or stored consent forms.<\/p><h3>Who can ignore the GDPR?&nbsp;<\/h3><p>GDPR does not apply to certain activities including processing covered by the&nbsp;Law Enforcement Directive, processing for national security purposes and processing carried out by individuals purely for personal\/household activities.<\/p><p>So yes, you don&rsquo;t have to permanently delete all your friends contact details from your phone.<\/p><h3>What data does GDPR apply to?&nbsp;<\/h3><ul><li><p><strong>Personal Data<\/strong>\nThis means data which relate to a living individual who can be identified; (a) from those data, or (b) from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller, and includes any expression of opinion about the individual and any indication of the intentions of the data controller or any other person in respect of the individual.\n\nFor example, names, home addresses, medical details, banking details and email addresses.<\/p><\/li><li><p><strong>Sensitive Personal Data<\/strong>\nThis means personal data consisting of information as to; (a) the racial or ethnic origin of the data subject, (b) his political opinions, (c) his religious beliefs or other beliefs of a similar nature, (d) whether he is a member of a trade union, (e) his physical or mental health or condition, (f) his sexual life, (g) the commission or alleged commission by him of any offence, or (h) any proceedings for any offence committed or alleged to have been committed by him, the disposal of such proceedings or the sentence of any court in such proceedings.<\/p><\/li><\/ul><p>Personal data is used in everything from online sales and customer relationship management, through to marketing - ouch!<\/p><h3>Other fun facts about GDPR?<\/h3><ul><li><p>There is now a legal right over personal data that is held by organisations. This means you can ask an organisation to permanently delete everything about yourself, or even ask for a human readable copy if you really wanted to. Remember those nuisance sales calls (PPI, recent car accidents), you&rsquo;ll now be able to ask them to completely delete your personal data from their system and they will have to comply by law - finally!<\/p><\/li><li><p>Almost all organisation will need to re-write their terms and conditions, privacy, and\/or contracts, etc. This means you&rsquo;ll likely have to re-read a few new documents for every organisation you have relation to.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Organisations should only collect the data that is actually needed to provide the intended goods or services. For example, Spotify should not be asking the gender of a user signing up, unless they have a valid and good reason for it, and you have legally agreed to hand over those details.<\/p><\/li><li><p>GDPR will still be enforced and made law even though the UK are leaving the EU.<\/p><\/li><li><p>For organisation that provide a service, or operate, within the EU and collect personal data, will need to provide a method of exporting your personal data in a human readable format, portability. For example, Spotify will need to enable you to export your playlists in a human readable format, this is very powerful!<\/p><\/li><li><p>Organisations that do not provide methods of gaining your personal data yourself, will therefor need to manually provide this data for you on request. These organisations will need to provide you with your personal data within 30 days of request, and will not be able to charge for this action.<\/p><\/li><li><p>In the event of a data breach, the maximum fine is &euro;20 million or 4% of an organisations annual global turnover - whichever is greater. These fines apply to all sectors (private, public, charities and individuals).<\/p><\/li><li><p>If a fine has been given for data breach, the fine that is applied to a &lsquo;controller&rsquo; or &lsquo;processor&rsquo; is dependent on how involved they were in the breach.<\/p><\/li><li><p>In the event of a data breach against an organisations in which personal data has been leaded, you have legally 72 hours to notify the ICO if you are impacted. Whether or not you need to notify a personnel such as customers or the general public, will depends on the level of impact in which the leaked data is believed to cause.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Organisation that enable encryption on personal data does not mean that certain areas of DGPR are solved. The data is still present and effectively accessible - it can still be accessed, it might just look different and take a lot longer for an intruder to decrypt.<\/p><\/li><li><p>It&rsquo;s been reported that the ability to prove valid consent for using personal information is likely to be one of the biggest challenges presented by the GDPR for organisations to comply with.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Organisations need to ensure that the use of simple language when asking for&nbsp;consent to collect personal data. An organisations needs to be clear about how the information will be used, and need to understand that silence or inactivity no longer constitutes consent.<\/p><\/li><li><p>It&rsquo;s now more important than ever for organisations to outline exactly what personal data they are collecting and how it will be processed and used. Without valid consent, any personal data processing activities will be shut down by ICO, or any related authorities.<\/p><\/li><li><p>GDPR not only applies to new personal data collected, but also all&nbsp;existing&nbsp;data that organisations hold. For example, If an organisations marketing subscription database includes data that was collected in a way that doesn&rsquo;t comply to the GDPR&rsquo;s standards, or if you can&rsquo;t provide sufficient proof of consent, you might not be allowed to send any more marketing material to those subscribers from the deadline.<\/p><\/li><li><p>GDPR not only applies to the personal data stored in digital formats, but also the data stored on paper and placed within an organisations filing cabinet. It&rsquo;s also important to remember that personal data is also stored on public and private CCTV systems - but thats another debate altogether.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Organisations can no longer have an automatic opt-in within terms and conditions, forms, or contracts. This means that just because you have been emailing Joe Blogs form an organisation, they should not be automatically adding you to their marketing lists, or officially and intentionally saving your details on their marketing system - unless you have legitimately and clearly given the organisation to do so.<\/p><\/li><\/ul><h3>How to comply with the GDPR?&nbsp;<\/h3><p>As mentioned, organisation that do not comply with the new GDPR&rsquo;s standard&#039;s, rack up the possibility that that organisation could be fined. Whether your organisation is a school, college, nursery, limited company, self-employed individual, you still need to comply. Let&rsquo;s list some tips on how you can do this.&nbsp;<\/p><ul><li><p><strong>Awareness - <\/strong>Make people related to your organisation aware that the DPA is changing and how it will affect areas. This doesn&rsquo;t need to be a long and boring process, just outline the important bits and why this is happening.<\/p><\/li><li><p><strong>Information - <\/strong>Find and audit the information you currently hold and what data processing policies are currently in place and publicly available. It&rsquo;s likely they will need to be updated. Remember, you should only be processing the data that your really need.<\/p><\/li><li><p><strong>Privacy - <\/strong>Review your current privacy agreement for your organisation and put a plan in place for any changes that are required, or necessary. Again, it&rsquo;s likely they will need to be updated.<\/p><\/li><li><p><strong>Rights - <\/strong>Check your organisation&rsquo;s current privacy policies to ensure your processes cover all the rights individuals have with the new DGPR. This should include areas such as, how they can request to permanently delete their personal data, and also that they can request a copy of all their personal data that you hold.<\/p><\/li><li><p><strong>Consent - <\/strong>Review how your organisation is seeking, obtaining and recording consent for data processing. Remember the process needs to be clear to the individual who is providing their personal data.<\/p><\/li><li><p><strong>Breaches - <\/strong>Make sure you have the correct procedures in place to investigate and report a data breach. This means having someone dedicated within your organisation that will process and notify the ICO within 72 hours.<\/p><\/li><li><p><strong>Students - <\/strong>Think about what systems you&#039;re going to put in place to verify the age of potential admission and on-role students, and to gather consent from parents or guardians in regards to data processing.<\/p><\/li><li><p><strong>Employees - <\/strong>Similar to that of the above &#039;Students&rsquo;, think about the system and process you are going to put in place to obtain employee data. Remember that you should only be processing the data that is actually needed.<\/p><\/li><li><p><strong>Officers - <\/strong>Similar to &lsquo;Breaches&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s recommended to designate a Data Protection Officer within your organisation to take responsibility for data protection compliance. This way it shouldn&rsquo;t get forgotten about and can be organised and kept current.<\/p><\/li><li><p><strong>e-Safety - <\/strong>Having an e-safety policy in place is vital to ensure all key stakeholders know what needs to be done to remain compliant. Schools should already have one in place for safeguarding reasons, it&rsquo;s likely this will also need to be updated.<\/p><\/li><li><p><strong>Processor - <\/strong>Choose an accredited Data Processor who is also compliant with GDPR obligations and IT asset disposal. Maybe this is undertaken in-house or by a third-party. Who ever you choose, are they compliant, do you trust them and are they staying current?<\/p><\/li><li><p><strong>Controller - <\/strong>Remember, your organisation is the &lsquo;controller&#039; of stored personal data used for your organisation. Whether you are the &lsquo;processor&rsquo;, or using a third-party, you still need to ensure your organisation comply with the new GDPR&rsquo;s standards before the deadline.<\/p><\/li><\/ul><p>I can understand that the fast approaching GDPR enforcement can seem overwhelming and scary, but one you understand it, it&rsquo;s really not that bad. It&rsquo;s here to stay so we just need to comply, get used to it and make it day-to-day procedures. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if your organisation doesn&rsquo;t benefit for these new laws, it&rsquo;s being put into force for you as an individual person\/human being, to protect you and give you rights against your personal data.<\/p><p>For as long as the ICO care, if your organisation has clear, ligament, proper and recorded consent for all data processing, you&rsquo;ll be just fine 👍<\/p>"},{"articleLiveDate":"2017-11-11T23:00:00Z","articleUpdateDate":null,"articleTitle":"Fun Fact: There is NO \"shocking\" cost for a web solution","articleUrlSlug":"no-shock-cost-of-web-design-solutions","articleDescription":"For years, I've witnessed so many leads that enter a state of shock by the costs of design, web and development services.

Maybe it&#039;s because of these try to Do It Yourself (DIY) online services that are popping up all over the place that cost just a few quid a month. Or maybe it&#039;s just that they think the solution being provided is a piece of cake and doesn&#039;t require any technical thinking or skill. It&#039;s not like we are providing a unique professional solution built from the ground up that can assist in your success, right?<\/h2><p>I am an independent provider of bespoke solutions. Solutions involving design and code aspects for web and mobile. I quote &ldquo;bespoke&rdquo; with pride and passion, because I&rsquo;ve seen many providers lately claiming to provide bespoke solutions - which you can see within their portfolio of work they clearly use templates. As you can imagine, this is very frustrating for myself and other similar folk. With that aside, let&rsquo;s get back on subject by jumping straight off and put things into perspective.<\/p><h3>Average Salary<\/h3><p>The reported average salary in the United Kingdom is &pound;37,000. That&#039;s &pound;3,083.33 per month or &pound;770.75 per week before tax deduction. Give 20% of that to the&nbsp;<em>much loved<\/em>&nbsp;Tax man and another chunk for National Insurance (NI), and you&#039;re going home with around &pound;28,327.20 in your back pocket.<\/p><p>With that in mind, the average quality bespoke website design and development solution&nbsp;<em>can<\/em>&nbsp;take around 2 to 8 (+\/-) months to complete, that&#039;s from first client introduction through to the big public launch. That&#039;s 8+ weeks or around 40 working days. That works out, using the average salary, we&rsquo;d expect the solution to cost between &pound;6,166.66 and &pound;9,249.99.<\/p><p>But get this&hellip; *queue drum roll* a massive percentage of&nbsp;designer and developers&nbsp;do you a favour and WON&rsquo;T price projects on how long they take, but on a per project bases instead - which you benefit from!<\/p><h3>Costing Methods<\/h3><p>During the pricing of a project, there are multiple areas on which effects the project costs. For example, maybe you need something to&nbsp;sell online with, such as an eCommerce. Or maybe you&#039;re an&nbsp;innovative startup that requires an &lsquo;all singing and dancing&rsquo; solution. At the end of the day, everything from the purpose; quality, time frame and features, will all have an impact on the costs for the solution being provided.<\/p><p>As an attempt to shed some light, I want to try to making it clearer on why design and development solutions shouldn&#039;t shock clients, but instead reassure them. Let&rsquo;s briefly go over the questions that projects are commonly priced on;<\/p><h4>Solve the Problem<\/h4><p>What is the problem that needs to be solved because for every problem, there is a solution. This is what solutions and services are based around. If there were no problems, there would be no need for solutions - simple.<\/p><h4>Features &amp; Functionality<\/h4><p>There is never a list of features or functionality set in stone. The needs and requirements are likely to change with every project, which is why 99.9% of projects are tailored to solve your problem. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s the source code for an iOS App or just raw design files, the chances of your project being exactly the same as another i&rsquo;ve just completed is very slim.<\/p><h4>Deadline or Time frame<\/h4><p>If you require your solution to be in place by a specific date, it&rsquo;s going to have an impact on costs. For example; you need an eCommerce solution designed, developed and launched before next Friday, then I&rsquo;ve got a challenge on my hands. I won&rsquo;t be sleeping for a week, and that&rsquo;s going to take a heavy impact on overall costs (as well as my heath).<\/p><h4>Quality &amp; Care<\/h4><p>I try to avoid repeating myself to everyone, but it&rsquo;s true. I&rsquo;ll also live by the phrase - &ldquo;quality over quantity&rdquo;, which is what I carry thought into all the solutions I provide. Would you rather pay for something that you know is going to work well and effectively, or would you prefer to pay quarter of the costs but be back at square one in 12 months time? Buy less, choose well.<\/p><h4>After Sales&nbsp;Support<\/h4><p>The continuation of support and advice after implementation of a solution can&nbsp;<em>sometimes<\/em>&nbsp;not be required, but will be appreciated. What if a minor tweak needed to be made three weeks or four months after implementation, that&rsquo;s when the after sales continuation truly matters and stands proud.<\/p><p>Is that what you expected to be accountable with the overall costings? Maybe, maybe not - but everything in life has a value, whether this is for the manufacturing or labour, it still holds value.<\/p><h3>Conclusion of Costs<\/h3><blockquote><p>OK, so why are others offering websites for &pound;395?<\/p><\/blockquote><p>This is the type of question I&rsquo;ve been asked more often than I should of. My answer always highlights that even a bespoke designed website towards the lower end of the scale can average from &pound;1,000+ - without questioning!<\/p><p>Ask yourself what the costs of buying a car today would be? You&rsquo;ll hesitate because there is no straight answer. Questions like this open up the flood gates to many more questions like; what make, model, body type, colour, engine size, fuel type, number of doors, new or used, mileage and all the other extras available. What about the cost of your time to source the car, order the car with a possible waiting list, or maybe even reach out to a broker. Then after you do finally get your hands on a car, you&rsquo;re going to need to run it - fuel costs, road tax, regular services, MOT tests, insurances and finally maintaining your car&hellip; yes *and breath*!<\/p><p>When it comes to any unique and bespoke solution, it comes down to one simple fact, you&rsquo;re receiving a professional, detailed and time \/ labour involved solution. It&rsquo;s certainly NOT a replicated and automated robot process like a &pound;395 website. You&rsquo;re a client we truly car about, not a number. Maybe look at it from another angle, you&#039;d like a brand new bespoke built-in wardrobe for your bedroom, both deigned and fitted - you can see where this is going.<\/p><p>Bespoke design services need to be discussed, understood, analysed, planned and THEN priced through a formal project proposal and quotation with all the above in mind. If you&rsquo;re reaching to an actual person to provide you with a design and development solution, then just remember you will be receiving a one-to-one bespoke service, to resolve your problem with their solution - so please, please expect costs for that particular solution to be of real life value. Not costs like a &pound;395 automated service. If not, then you&rsquo;re likely looking for the wrong solution and shouldn&rsquo;t waste anybody else time.<\/p>"},{"articleLiveDate":"2017-10-31T00:00:00Z","articleUpdateDate":null,"articleTitle":"Football ground street signs are wrong, says fan - BBC NEWS","articleUrlSlug":"football-street-signs-wrong","articleDescription":"The tussle at its heart?

Possibly a pretty pink Wendy playhouse? Being a creative and DIY &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; kind of guy, I&rsquo;d be building something unique from the ground up - I didn&rsquo;t build a Wendy playhouse, I went all out and creating something not many kids have. I built them a Hobbit Adventure like no other.<\/h2><p>This particular personal family project begin back in October 2016, when my partner, Georgina, and I talked about buying our daughters a &ldquo;girly&rdquo; Wendy playhouse for them to play&nbsp;and store their toys in. I initially agreed and became quite fond of the idea, but having Scottish in my blood, I started to become against the idea. It was the&nbsp;idea of buying something I knew I could build. I also thought most playhouses on the market were rather boring, they were basically all very similar to one another.<\/p><p>In the end, we both agreed that I&rsquo;d build our daughters a playhouse. I yearn for letting my creative juices flow while having fun - let&rsquo;s build a Hobbit Hole Playhouse!<\/p><p>Around September 2016, the build started. The structure would have to withstand earth being placed on top, people walking over it and damp surroundings. Because I planned on building an REAL miniature &ldquo;semi-under ground&rdquo; Hobbit Hole. Not a Hobbit styled garden shed.<\/p><h3>Let&#039;s build<\/h3><p>[image: chriswatterston.com\/application\/files\/7315\/0659\/4515\/hobbit-hole-playhouse-01.jpg]<\/p><p>I used an old 7&rsquo;ish metre 10mm RSJ steel beam for the main structural framework, this was perfect as it was strong, durable and workable. Cutting this down the middle then created 2 equal T-section steel lengths, to then be aligned and welded together to create 2 trapezoid shaped frames. I then used another smaller 10mm RSJ steel beam to fix between the top sections of the trapezoids. I then strapped the frame up and lifted into were we wanted it, allowing me to mark on the grass which area would be excavated and how deep.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Once we were happy with the placement and depth, I moved the structure to start excavation a large hole 600mm deep. I also installed a number of 8&rdquo;x2&rdquo; treated wooden lengths to the structure, enabling an easy base for when I start constructing the walls. After I was happy with the framework and structure knowing it was strong enough and safe enough, I moved onto the interior.<\/p><p>[image: chriswatterston.com\/application\/files\/8015\/0659\/4512\/hobbit-hole-playhouse-02.jpg]<\/p><p>[image: chriswatterston.com\/application\/files\/1415\/0659\/4510\/hobbit-hole-playhouse-03.jpg]<\/p><p>Naturally, being a Hobbit Hole the interior needed to look and feel natural. I nipped to Wickes to pick up some Plywood and made a start on the interior. The sides and rear walls of the Hobbit Hole would be be covered in earth, so these were fitted inside and outside with 18mm chipboard. The front side wouldn&rsquo;t have any earth weight against it, so 9mm Plywood was used. The roofs exterior, like the sides and rear, had 18mm chipboard. For the roofs interior, I decided to make this a lighting feature and create a &lsquo;Star Ceiling&rsquo; effect. Instead of using a traditional optic fibre lighting system to create the desired effect, instead I used the cheaper and tougher option of white LED Christmas lights. I first intended to have the stars scattered, but due to the structure and limitation of the lights and avoiding the wastage of valuable light, since it was going to be quite&nbsp;a dark space, I decided to lay them out in a &lsquo;zig-zag&rsquo; and use every available bulb. After approval from our eldest daughter, Ellie, I continued to mark every lights placement with a black dot and drilled a 4mm hole through the Plywood to home the lights, finally fixing with a glue gun.&nbsp;<\/p><p>[image: chriswatterston.com\/application\/files\/1615\/0659\/4516\/hobbit-hole-playhouse-04.jpg]<\/p><p>[image: chriswatterston.com\/application\/files\/1215\/0659\/4513\/hobbit-hole-playhouse-05.jpg]<\/p><p>Now that the &lsquo;Star Ceiling&rsquo; was built, tested and installed, it was time to lift the Hobbit Hole one last time and drop it into its final resting place.<\/p><p>The hole was lined with 1mm plastic as damp proofing, with the structure then placed inside of that, I continued to wrap the whole structure in the same plastic, excluding the front wall. I then used sections from an old chopped up glass fibre pond to help add extra strength and seal the top. Sealing the floor, I used concrete. Thankfully, when it came to filling the base and exteriors outer edges with roughly 200mm of concrete, we had my partners nephew, George, staying who saved a lot of heat, sweat and red faces - good man!&nbsp;<\/p><p>[image: chriswatterston.com\/application\/files\/9015\/0659\/4520\/hobbit-hole-playhouse-07.jpg]<\/p><p>[image: chriswatterston.com\/application\/files\/5215\/0659\/4521\/hobbit-hole-playhouse-08.jpg]<\/p><p>While the concrete we laid it in the morning was left to set and harden, during the afternoon, George and I decided to dig and run armoured cable into the Hobbit Hole. Throughout the week, I moved onto building and installing a Hobbit style door, sealed the exposed Plywood with liquid damp proofing and finally started to pile earth around the rear and sides. To control the lighting and ensure there were no exposed switches for the children, I tucked all the electrical components and connections away in a secure wall box, fitted with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.lightwaverf.com\/solution\/smart-home\/\" title=\"\">LightwaveRF<\/a>&nbsp;inline relay. This meant we could control the lighting by remote or through our smartphones.<\/p><p>[image: chriswatterston.com\/application\/files\/2315\/0659\/4523\/hobbit-hole-playhouse-09.jpg]<\/p><p>[image: chriswatterston.com\/application\/files\/3015\/0659\/4525\/hobbit-hole-playhouse-10.jpg]<\/p><p>Moving on, now that the concrete had set and safe enough to climb inside, it was time to decorate and create a feature wall. I decided on creating a feature wall which involved log slices, so I set-up the cradle and fired the McCulloch chainsaw into life. Cutting each slice of already seasoned wood at approximately the same thickness. In total,&nbsp;cut roughly 2 large buckets to have enough to completely cover the rear wall.&nbsp;<\/p><p>[image: chriswatterston.com\/application\/files\/4615\/0659\/4526\/hobbit-hole-playhouse-11.jpg]<\/p><p>Before the slices were placed onto the wall, I ensured any dust was brushed off. I got myself 3 tubes of &#039;Sticks Like&#039;&nbsp;shit&nbsp;and started slapping them onto the rear wall in a random like pattern. I continued through and finished the feature wall, as well as covering the external liquid damp proofing with artificial grass, and found an old vintage light to hang outside the front which I filled with the remaining &#039;Star Ceiling&rsquo; LED lights. I was very VERY happy with how this turned out and how the whole thing was looking, admittedly, I was defiantly more excited at this point than our daughters were.<\/p><p>[image: chriswatterston.com\/application\/files\/1615\/0659\/4528\/hobbit-hole-playhouse-12.jpg]<\/p><p>The Interior was now complete and working, it was damp proofed and grass was slowly but surely starting to growing on the roof and up the sides. Things were working out great! I now needed to cover the exposed blue plastic wrap around the front, doing so with an old corrugated roofing sheet. Cut to size and overlapped, secured with concrete, expandable foam and pop rivets - and finally finished off with a lick of brown paint to help blend in and look natural. I also created 2 log retaining walls to help hold back the earth, held together by large pins that are put through every log and then into the ground.<\/p><p>[image: chriswatterston.com\/application\/files\/2315\/0659\/4529\/hobbit-hole-playhouse-13.jpg]<\/p><p>[image: chriswatterston.com\/application\/files\/3815\/0659\/4531\/hobbit-hole-playhouse-14.jpg]<\/p><h3>Thoughts on the final outcome<\/h3><p>Fast forward over 6 months, I&rsquo;m happy with how things look and worked out. This wasn&rsquo;t a step-by-step planned projects, it was merely a &quot;make it up as you go along&quot; kind of project with no deadlines, which was nice. Projects like this give you the opportunity to chop and change ideas as you go, but can also allow you to forget to do things that you should of done - but lucky for me I hadn&rsquo;t&hellip; I think?<\/p><p>The grass hasn&rsquo;t fully grown yet and is still a tad patchy, but it will grow in time. My partner has recently planted strawberries and scattered coloured wild flower seeds, so next year things should look even better. This is the type of project that looks better and more natural as time goes on, when nature tries to take over again.

Supporting and spending time with my 2 beautiful girls and partner, building a loving home, paying bills, working as an independent self employed designer, marketing, paperwork, trying to socialise with friends, exercising, cycling, gardening, 6 ducks, running 2 cars, selling 1 car, restoring my old 1980&#039;s Broom Speedboat and my MK1 Fiesta XR2... bla, bla, bla.

But they were to continue with the explosion of work at that current time and continue with the targets and challenges from 2014.<\/p><h3>So, how did I do?<\/h3><p>Starting was a positive, target one was a success. Too right, this was my main point. Cutting costs meant I could use these &ldquo;savings&rdquo; else where. Like marketing for example. Areas I cut or altered and made massive savings on were; server environments, domain names, everyday work and office space, cycling instead of driving when I could, and I also cut a number of online third-party services that I didn&rsquo;t really need but thought it would be nice to have. You know the ones.<\/p><p>Secondly, provide design and development solutions to at least two charities. Unfortunately this didn&rsquo;t happen. Everything was in place ready for promotion, but I was just to busy at that particular time. People would say &ldquo;make the time&rdquo;, but running my &lsquo;one-man band&rsquo; business, having a family and spending time with them and living, plus everything else. I just really couldn&rsquo;t find the time. Maybe this year?<\/p><p>Write more. Post at least one blog article per month.
