                            <p>My name is Chris Watterston. I'm a Digital Product Design & Manager based just on the outskirts of London (UK), with a strong background in digital design and web development.</p>
                            <p>I'm passionate about agile digital product design and architecture, web design, development, and product growth. When it comes to digital products- I care a ton about how they look, function, grow with meaning, and the learnings they teach.</p>
                            <p>I also enjoy spending time with family and friends, stepping outdoors, and trying to find the time to kiteboard.</p>

                                    <h5>Suntory Beverage & Food GB&I</h5>
                                    <p class="_post-date">March 2018 - Present (Remote + Uxbridge)</p>

                            <p>Lucozade Energy, Lucozade Sport, Ribena, Merchants Heart, and a handful of others. The products that hydrated, supported, and clenched the thirst of millions of people.</p>
                            <p>During my time at Suntory GB&I, I was lucky enough to work on some of the biggest FMCG digital products and campaigns for many much loved brands. Joining the small team as a freelancer Web Design and Developer in 2018, I hung around and continued the journey to lead the Digital & Technology team 4 years later in a permanent role.</p>
                            <p>This role involved several responsibilities. Agile digital product management, strategy and scoping, data analytics, designing, UAT/QA testing, building and launching consumer web entry mechanics and interfaces (inc. websites, apps & marketing material), collaborating and supporting legal and brand- and countless other bits, such as managing budgets and external agencies.</p>

                            <p>While working for Suntory GB&I within their in-house agency, we used Wrike.com for all project management and planning. For this reason, I also became part of the small team which supported the roll out of Wrike scroll Suntory's European business units. This forced me to become very familiar with Wrike.</p>
                            <p>During this time and using what Wrike claim to be the most powerful work management software, I quickly recognised a hole within Wrike's large audience which they hadn't tailored for. This brought on the idea of Wrikified.</p>
                            <p>The idea behind Wrikified, is to remove the noise and make Wrike simple. Continue to use the most powerful work management software but simplified for production teams.</p>

                            <p>During this period, I made myself responsible in providing a range of high-end and guaranteed solutions to my sourced clients (never via agencies). These clients ranged from small start-ups, fully established organisations, brands, and schools (both private and public)- as well as the odd individual.
