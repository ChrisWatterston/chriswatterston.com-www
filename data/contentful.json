The sides and rear walls of the Hobbit Hole would be be covered in earth, so these were fitted inside and outside with 18mm chipboard. The front side wouldn\u2019t have any earth weight against it, so 9mm Plywood was used. The roofs exterior, like the sides and rear, had 18mm chipboard. For the roofs interior, I decided to make this a lighting feature and create a \u2018Star Ceiling\u2019 effect. Instead of using a traditional optic fibre lighting system to create the desired effect, instead I used the cheaper and tougher option of white LED Christmas lights. I first intended to have the stars scattered, but due to the structure and limitation of the lights and avoiding the wastage of valuable light, since it was going to be quite\u00a0a dark space, I decided to lay them out in a \u2018zig-zag\u2019 and use every available bulb. After approval from our eldest daughter, Ellie, I continued to mark every lights placement with a black dot and drilled a 4mm hole through the Plywood to home the lights, finally fixing with a glue gun.\u00a0",

The hard working\u00a0single father in this advert works every second of the day, but when the time finally come that he can show his daughter that he does can, it\u2019s to late and she storms out the room. The night of the Winter Show finaly comes and she\u2019s seen peeking through the curtains looking for her dad, but thinks work has taken priority yet again. But to her surprise, her loving dad is watching. He realises her nerves, puts away his phone and\u00a0stands up. From the back of the hall, he supports her\u00a0by showing that he DID pay attention to her every move. This is a very well thought out and stunning advert and defiantly my #1 for the 2017 Christmas Advert lineup.",
