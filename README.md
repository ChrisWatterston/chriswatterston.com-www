## What is this?

This here, is my personal portfolio and blog design, which I design and developed in September 2022. You'll be able to find the final and working version at chriswatterston.com.

I've had many personal portfolio websites in the past, hence why you'll notice some of the work shown goes back to as early as 2014.

Anyhow, enjoy!

> If you do duplicate and make this the foundation for your website, please do share. I'd love to see it!
