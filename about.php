                            <p>My name is Chris Watterston. I'm an agile and visionary <strong>Digital Product Builder</strong>.</p>
                            <p>At the core of my profession lies invaluable skills in <strong>Digital Product Design</strong> and <strong>Management</strong>, backed by a strong background in <strong>Web Development</strong>, <strong>User Experience (UX)</strong>, and <strong>Digital Technologies</strong>.</p>
                            <p>As of 2023, I have <strong>over 13 years experience in bring award winning digital products to life</strong>.</p>
                            <p>Throughout my career, I've worked with some of the biggest brands. Lucozade, Ribena, Orangina, Microsoft Xbox, Hasbro Gaming, Anthony Joshua Boxing, the England football teams, Kyocera, UCC Coffee, Lyons Coffee, Metricly, and the British Society of Paediatric Dentistry to mention a few.</p>
                            <p>I started my career working for an educational IT services provider, handling web project design and management for over 30 clients.</p>
                            <p>5 years later, I took a leap in becoming a freelance Digital Designer and Developer. It was during this time I noticed my entrepreneurial spirit and passion for building digital solutions and products from the ground up. Understanding the foundations of business, agility, client management, and the benefits of working swiftly.</p>
                            <p>Next, I joined Suntory Beverage & Food in supporting their creative in-house agency. I continued to make headway and later lead the Digital Design & Technology team in supporting the growth of the team. During this period, <strong>I designed, built, managed, and launched some of their biggest digital products and campaigns to date, deploying to over 8.1 million unique users- winning multiple ESA Awards.</strong></p>
                            <p>I have built a passion for agile digital product design, UX, development, build (0-1) and growth. When it comes to digital products- I care about how they look, function, create value, and what we can learn from them and their users.</p>
                            <p>When I'm not building, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, being outdoors and kite boarding.</p>

                                <p>While I was freelancing for over 7 years, I thrived by throwing myself into the deep end of any challenge that would arise. This taught and allowed me to learn at a rapid pace. Understanding the foundations of business, agility, client management, and the benefits of working swiftly.</p>
                                <p>I was responsible for everything required to run the business. Not only did I provide high-end and guaranteed digital solutions directly to my clients, but also handled digital marketing and finances. Clients ranged from start-ups, established organisations, schools and colleges.</p>
                                <p>It was during this time I noticed my entrepreneurial spirit and passion for building digital solutions and products from the ground up.</p>
